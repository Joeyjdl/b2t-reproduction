# FACT

To run the colab notebook, you need to add in your own github api key to allow the notebook to download the rest of the github.

### Open in Google Colab ðŸš€

If this is a private repository, follow these steps:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Click the "GitHub" tab.
3. Sign in with your GitHub account.
4. Search for this repository and open the notebook manually. (Open experiment.ipynb for most experiments, figure3.ipynb for figure 3 and figure5.ipynb for figure 5)
5. Set runtime to T4 GPU
6. Add your personal acces token in the notebook. This is needed to download the github repo into colab.
7. The code is pre-run. However if you want to run it yourself, this needs to be done sequentially as it might not work otherwise.

For the debias code, see the readme in the b2t/b2t_debias.
